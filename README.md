# WhyNotsApp

This is an Android Chat Application I designed during my free time. This app follows the general material design guidelines and uses Firebase for authentication, storage, database and for notification log.

## Bugs

This app is still not perfect and has some bugs but can be used as a daily form of communication. The major problem with is app right now is that the push notifications don't work (I actually got frustrated and abandoned it midway :P).

Some other major bugs include sending an image as message. Image can be sent as a message, but that's it. You can't view the images completely and it messes up the RecyclerView layout in Chat Activity.

There also maybe some scaling issues because I designed this app in RelativeLayout with a 5.5 inch phone with 500 dpi.
